# LOOPS (16pts TOTAL)

# PROBLEM 1 (Fibonacci - 4pts)
## The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers that starts with 1, followed by 1 again.
# Every next number is the sum of the two previous numbers.
# I.e., the sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...
# Write a program that calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence
# until the numbers get higher than 1000.

num1 = 1
num2 = 1
num3 = 2

    num1 = num2
    num2 = num3
    if num3 > 1000:
        break
    print(num3)

# PROBLEM 2 (Dice Sequence - 6pts)
# You roll five six-sided dice, one by one.
# What is the probability that the value of each die
# is greater than OR EQUAL TO the value of the previous die that you rolled?
# For example, the sequence “1, 1, 4, 4, 6” is a success,
# but “1, 1, 4, 3, 6” is not. Determine the
# probability of success using a simulation of a large number of trials.

# PROBLEM 3 (Number Puzzler - 6pts)
# A, B, C, and D are all different digits.
# The number DCBA is equal to 4 times the number ABCD.
# What are the digits?
# Note: to make ABCD and DCBA conventional numbers, neither A nor D can be zero.
# Use a quadruple-nested loop to solve.
